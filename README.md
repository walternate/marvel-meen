marvel-meen
===========

A MongoDB, Express, Ember, Node.js application built using Ember-cli to showcase the wonder of the Marvel API.

Requires node >= 0.10.29, npm >= 1.5, mongod >= 2.4.9, and ember-cli >= 0.0.39

This repo was made for those looking for an interesting working example of an Express and Ember.js application (built with ember-cli).  It is by no means perfect and I'm sure could be improved in a number of ways.  As a matter of fact I'm a quite new to Ember!  So hack and break as much as you can!  It's my very favorite way to learn :D
